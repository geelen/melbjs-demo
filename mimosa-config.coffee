  # minMimosaVersion:null   # The minimum Mimosa version that must be installed to use the
                            # project. Defaults to null, which means Mimosa will not check
                            # the version.  This is a no-nonsense way for big teams to ensure
                            # everyone stays up to date with the blessed Mimosa version for a
                            # project.

  ###
  The list of Mimosa modules to use for this application. The defaults (lint, server, require,
  minify, live-reload) come bundled with Mimosa and do not need to be installed.  The 'mimosa-'
  that preceeds all Mimosa module names is assumed, however you can use it if you want.  If a
  module is listed here that Mimosa is unaware of, Mimosa will attempt to install it.
